Volatility Framework - Volatile memory extraction utility framework
============================================================================

The Volatility Framework is a completely open collection of tools,
implemented in Python under the GNU General Public License, for the
extraction of digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples.
The extraction techniques are performed completely independent of the
system being investigated but offer visibilty into the runtime state
of the system. The framework is intended to introduce people to the
techniques and complexities associated with extracting digital artifacts
from volatile memory samples and provide a platform for further work into
this exciting area of research.

The Volatility distribution is available from: 
http://www.volatilityfoundation.org/#!releases/component_71401

Volatility should run on any platform that supports 
Python (http://www.python.org)

Volatility supports investigations of the following memory images:

Volatility does not provide memory sample acquisition
capabilities. For acquisition, there are both free and commercial
solutions available. If you would like suggestions about suitable 
acquisition solutions, please contact us at:

volatility (at) volatilityfoundation (dot) org

Volatility supports a variety of sample file formats and the
ability to convert between these formats:

  - Raw linear sample (dd)
  - Hibernation file
  - Crash dump file
  - VirtualBox ELF64 core dump
  - VMware saved state and snapshot files
  - EWF format (E01) 
  - LiME (Linux Memory Extractor) format
  - Mach-o file format 
  - QEMU virtual machine dumps
  - Firewire 
  - HPAK (FDPro)

3. To get more information on a Windows memory sample and to make sure Volatility
   supports that sample type, run 'python vol.py imageinfo -f <imagename>' or 'python vol.py kdbgscan -f <imagename>'

   Example:
   
    $ python vol.py imageinfo -f WIN-II7VOJTUNGL-20120324-193051.raw

4. Run some other plugins. -f is a required option for all plugins. Some
   also require/accept other options. Run "python vol.py <plugin> -h" for
   more information on a particular command.  A Command Reference wiki
   is also available on the Google Code site:
